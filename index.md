I see trees of green<br>
Red roses too<br>
I see them bloom<br>
For me and you<br>
And I think to myself<br>
What a wonderful world<br>
</td>
<td>
I see skies of blue<br>
And clouds of white<br>
The bright blessed day<br>
The dark sacred night<br>
And I think to myself<br>
What a wonderful world<br>
</td>
<td>
The colors of the rainbow<br>
So pretty in the sky<br>
Are also on the faces<br>
Of people going by<br>

I see friends shaking hands<br>
Saying, "How do you do?"<br>
They′re really saying<br>
"I love you"<br>

I hear babies cry<br>
I watch them grow<br>
They'll learn much more<br>
Than I′ll ever know<br>
And I think to myself<br>
What a wonderful world<br>

Yes, I think to myself<br>
What a wonderful world<br>
Ooh yeah ...<br>
