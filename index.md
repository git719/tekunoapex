I see trees of green<br />
Red roses too<br />
I see them bloom<br />
For me and for you<br />
And I think to myself<br />
What a wonderful world<br />
<br />
I see skies of blue<br />
And clouds of white<br />
The bright blessed day<br />
The dark sacred night<br />
And I think to myself<br />
What a wonderful world<br />
<br />
The colors of the rainbow<br />
So pretty in the sky<br />
Are also on the faces<br />
Of people going by<br />
<br />
I see friends shaking hands<br />
Saying, "How do you do?"<br />
They′re really saying<br />
"I love you"<br />
<br />
I hear babies cry<br />
I watch them grow<br />
They'll learn much more<br />
Than I′ll ever know<br />
And I think to myself<br />
What a wonderful world<br />
<br />
Yes, I think to myself<br />
What a wonderful world<br />
Ooh yeah<br />
