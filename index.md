Some say the world will end in fire,<br /> 
Some say in ice.<br /> 
From what I’ve tasted of desire<br /> 
I hold with those who favor fire.<br /> 
But if it had to perish twice,<br /> 
I think I know enough of hate<br /> 
To say that for destruction ice<br /> 
Is also great<br /> 
And would suffice.<br />
