I see trees of green           I see skies of blue           The colors of the rainbow
Red roses too                  And clouds of white           So pretty in the sky
I see them bloom         ──►   The bright blessed day  ──►   Are also on the faces
For me and you                 The dark sacred night         Of people going by
And I think to myself          And I think to myself         ...
What a wonderful world         What a wonderful world

I see friends shaking hands    I hear babies cry             Yes, I think to myself
Saying, "How do you do?"       I watch them grow             What a wonderful world
They′re really saying    ──►   They'll learn much more  ──►  Ooh yeah ...
"I love you"                   Than I′ll ever know
                               And I think to myself
                               What a wonderful world
